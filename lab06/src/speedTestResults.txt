I ran the speedtest and i put in various string lengths (20, 50, 100) and also put in various # of strings (10, 20, 50).
every time I ran it, I got the following results:
        class ULLMap: 0.00 sec
        class BSTMap: 0.00 sec
        Java's Built-in TreeMap: 0.00 sec
        Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.00 sec
